# a-tcn-birnn-mlp-for-predicting-protein-secondary-structure

This project uses a hybrid neural network model that combines Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BiRNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict the secondary structure of proteins.

## 项目简介

a-tcn-birnn-mlp-for-predicting-protein-secondary-structure is a research project that uses deep learning methods to predict protein secondary structure. By combining three different neural network structures, TCN, BiRNN, and MLP, this project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of protein secondary structure prediction.

## 特性

- A hybrid model that combines TCN, BiRNN, and MLP.
- Efficient data processing and model training process.
- Provides pre-trained models and easy-to-use prediction scripts.


## 使用
The model part of this article mainly includes the main model used in this article, and utils and layers are the necessary single-layer architecture and word vector processing parts of the model. After running the three python files, run run to get the results.
